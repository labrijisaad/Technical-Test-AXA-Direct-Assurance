# Data Science Technical Test Solution
This repository contains the solution for the Data Science Technical Test.


## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

* `data/`: This directory contains the necessary data files for the analysis.
* `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the code for the data analysis.
* `results/`: This directory contains the output files and visualizations generated during the analysis.
* `src/`: This directory contains any additional source code or scripts used in the analysis.
* `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to reproduce the analysis.
* `.gitignore`: This file contains the list of files that are ignored by git.
* `requirements.txt`: This file contains the list of packages that are required to run the analysis.
* `.env`: This file contains the environment variables used in the analysis.

## Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. Place the necessary data files in the `data/` directory.

8. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

9. Open the desired notebook in the notebooks/ directory for analysis.

 > ⚠️ Please note that the dataset files (`data/`) are excluded from version control using `.gitignore` for confidentiality reasons.
